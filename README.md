# Python-Language-Translator-
This project is a simple and user-friendly Language Translator Web App built using Flask (Python) and Google Translate API (googletrans). It allows users to translate text from one language to another instantly through a clean web interface.

# Project Overview
The Language Translator App takes user input text, a source language, and a destination language, then translates the text dynamically using Google’s translation service. The application follows a Flask MVC structure, separating backend logic, frontend templates, and static assets for better maintainability.
